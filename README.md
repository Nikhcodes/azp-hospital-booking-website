# AZP Hospital Booking Website

A modern, responsive website for **Academisch Ziekenhuis Paramaribo (AZP)** built as a **portfolio project**.  

The project showcases **full-stack development, UX design, and professional layout** for a real-world use case. I built this project to demonstrate my skills in designing clean, accessible interfaces and connecting a frontend with a backend database for interactive functionality.

**Tech Stack:**

- **Frontend:** React (Vite), Tailwind CSS (v4)  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express  
- **Database:** MariaDB  

This project includes:

- Homepage with hero and department previews  
- Departments page detailing medical services  
- Appointment booking form with backend API  
- Contact page with hospital information  

The goal was to create a **polished, professional-looking site** that reflects how I would structure and design real-world applications for production.
